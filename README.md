# Infection Simulation

A simulation of the spread of an infectious desease through a population based on a SIR model.

## Getting Started

Running this program takes the InputParameters.json file and iteratively solves the SIR model using 
a [Runge Kutta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods) technique (Currently the [Simple Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method) but will add more advanced solvers)

## Built With
